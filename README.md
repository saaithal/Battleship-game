# Battleship
Battleship is a classic two person game, originally played with pen and paper.

On a grid (typically 10 x 10), players ’hide’ ships of mixed length; horizontally or vertically (not diagonally) without any overlaps. The exact types and number of ships varies by rule, but for this posting, I’m using ships of lengths: 5, 4, 3, 3, 2 (which results in 17 possible targets out of the total of 100 squares).
